# LoanShield — Secure & Automated Credit Decisioning Engine

LoanShield is an enterprise-grade automated lending decision platform built on Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK 2.0). It ingests credit applications, redacts sensitive PII, executes parallel financial analysis and compliance verification using stdio Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, calculates a multi-factor credit risk score, and dispatches regulatory ECOA-aligned explanation letters.

## 🏛️ System Architecture

The LoanShield processing pipeline is structured as a LangGraph state workflow:

## 🤝 Multi-Agent Core Framework

LoanShield implements a structured multi-agent cooperation architecture using Google ADK to distribute responsibility across highly specialized agents:

1. **Orchestrator Agent (LangGraph Coordinator)**
   * **Role**: Governs the application lifecycle and execution state.
   * **Responsibilities**: Sequences intake triggers, coordinates parallel branch fan-out/fan-in processing (Financial + Fraud agents), resolves conditional routes, and manages HITL wait interrupts for underwriters.

2. **Gatekeeper Agent**
   * **Role**: Data intake, security sanitization, and document validation.
   * **Responsibilities**: Executes `pii_redactor_skill` to sanitize raw SSN, DOB, phone, and address into anonymized tokens. Queries the `document_storage_mcp_final.json` database. Pauses execution with an interrupt if documentation status is `INCOMPLETE`.

3. **Financial Analyst Agent**
   * **Role**: Financial profile check, verification of stated parameters, and affordability math.
   * **Responsibilities**: Invokes standard MCP server tools to query bank deposit lists, credit bureau indicators, and employment profiles. Executes the `income_verify_skill` to detect monthly deposit variances (flags >100% variance as fraud). Executes the `dti_calculator_skill` to score total monthly DTI debt obligations.

4. **Fraud & Compliance Agent**
   * **Role**: Anti-fraud filters and circuit breakers.
   * **Responsibilities**: Enforces strict operational guardrails based on credit history and age limits:
     * *Synthetic Fraud Rule*: Catches anomalies where credit age < 6 months but credit score > 780.
     * *Immaturity/High-exposure Rule*: Flags applicants under 21 requesting > $100,000.
     * *Employment Stable Income Check*: Screens for employment status = `Terminated`.
     * Instantly sets `fraud_flag = True` to bypass score calculations and trigger immediate rejection.

5. **Explanations Agent (Compliance Officer)**
   * **Role**: Regulatory adverse action notice compiler.
   * **Responsibilities**: Evaluates final node outcomes and builds credit decision notification letters using the `explanation_skill` LLM agent, aligning declines with Section 701(a) of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) (e.g. low FICO score, high DTI, fraud triggers) and masking all PII.

## 🚀 Local Development Commands

This project uses `uv` for dependency management. Access all tasks via the `Makefile`:

### 1. Installation
Install Python dependencies and sync the virtual environment:
```bash
make install
```

### 2. Playground Execution
Launch the local ADK web playground interface for manual underwriter checks:
```bash
make playground
```
*Access the interface locally at `http://127.0.0.1:18081`.*

### 3. Automated Testing
Run the complete unit, MCP, and graph integration test suite:
```bash
make test
```
*Note: The end-to-end test executes and verifies all 54 applicants from the benchmark dataset.*

## 📊 Decision Routing Grid

The LoanShield scoring engine generates risk scores ($0 - 100$) and routes decisions according to these criteria:

*   **Auto-Approve** (Score $\ge 70$, zero fraud flags): Applications are approved instantly.
*   **Human Review** (Score $40 - 69$, zero fraud flags): Suspends workflow with a HITL interrupt, requesting underwriter verification.
*   **Auto-Reject** (Score $< 40$ OR any fraud flag): Rejects application and drafts a regulatory ECOA-compliant adverse action letter.

---

## 🖥️ Custom Web Application Portal

We built a custom, high-fidelity web gateway interface for LoanShield, replacing the generic command-line or basic forms with a state-of-the-art underwriting workstation:
1.  **3D WebGL Backdrop**: Utilizes **Three.js** to render a real-time, dot-matrix animated particle field that responds dynamically to pointer coordinates via parallax drift and features a slow breathing pulse.
2.  **Translucent Glassmorphism Panels**: Built with a sleek dark aesthetic (`#0A0A0A`) accented by neon green (`#A3E635`), utilizing glass panels with `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)`.
3.  **Live Node Graph Workflow**: Displays the exact LangGraph agent node layout connected by active, pulsing SVG bezier connection paths that light up in real-time.
4.  **EventSource (SSE) Streaming**: Connects directly to the backend memory runner to stream node state transitions (`running`, `paused`, `completed`, `failed`) and transition logs.
5.  **Audit Trail Terminal Logs**: Simulates a CLI logs terminal directly on the page, with info/warning/critical color-coding.
6.  **Interactive Underwriter Overrides Box**: Pauses execution and pops up override control buttons (`APPROVE`, `REJECT`, `RESUME`) when human intervention is triggered.

## 📸 Web UI Execution Screenshots

### 1. Loan Shield Enter Gemini API Key (Security & Configuration)
![Enter Gemini API Key prompt](loanshield/docs/images/api_key_prompt.png)
*When accessing the portal for the first time, users are presented with this sleek dark glassmorphism modal to enter their **Gemini API Key** before proceeding. This key is stored securely in the browser's `localStorage` and sent dynamically for underwriting operations, removing any dependency on server-side secrets when hosted in cloud environments like Vercel.*

### 2. Loan Shield Human in loop Approval
![Human in Loop Approval Escalation](loanshield/docs/images/hitl_approval_pending.png)
*This screenshot illustrates the workflow paused at `human_underwriter_hitl_node` (pulsing orange). Because the risk score of 64.1 lies within the review threshold, the process suspends and displays interactive **APPROVE LOAN** and **REJECT LOAN** override buttons in the bottom-right panel.*

---

### 3. Loan Shield Rejected
![Synthetic Fraud Rejection](loanshield/docs/images/application_rejected.png)
*This screenshot demonstrates the auto-rejection state for applicant Grace Carter. A synthetic fraud identity mismatch is flagged, resulting in a risk score of 80.8 being overridden to a **REJECTED** verdict. The formal ECOA Credit Notice letter details the specific adverse action reasons at the bottom.*

---

### 4. Loan Shield Auto Approved
![Prime Auto Approval](loanshield/docs/images/auto_approved.png)
*This screenshot shows a prime credit application (Liam Smith) being successfully processed. The risk scorer evaluates the profile at a composite score of 85.4, resulting in a final verdict of **APPROVED** (green badge) and drafting the congratulations approval notice.*

---

### 5. Loan Shield Human in Loop Approved
![HITL Overridden Approval](loanshield/docs/images/hitl_approved.png)
*This screenshot showcases the application state after the human underwriter clicks the **APPROVE LOAN** override button for Harper Robinson. The workflow resumes from its paused state, evaluates the final decision as **APPROVED**, and displays the completed audit trail logs.*

## 🎮 Google ADK Developer Playground Walkthrough

For low-level tracing, debugging, and inspecting state changes between individual LangGraph nodes, you can execute the workflow inside the built-in **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) Playground**:

### 1. ADK Playground Initialized
![ADK Playground Initialized](loanshield/docs/images/adk_playground_init.png)
*The default, clean workspace interface of the Google ADK playground portal, loaded with the `app` configuration. From here, you can initiate new underwriting traces, inspect state histories, evaluate metrics, and send custom JSON application messages.*

---

### 2. ADK Playground Execution Started
![ADK Playground Execution Started](loanshield/docs/images/adk_playground_started.png)
*This screenshot shows the initial stages of a test run for Liam Smith. The intake payload triggers the graph, the `gatekeeper_node` tokenizes the PII details, and the execution flows to the parallel financial and compliance branches.*

---

### 3. ADK Playground Execution Completed
![ADK Playground Execution Completed](loanshield/docs/images/adk_playground_completed.png)
*This screenshot shows the complete, successfully resolved 14-step event trace history. You can inspect the final computed risk score (85.42), the automated approval routing edge transition, and the completed ECOA credit notice letter generated by the Explanations agent.*
